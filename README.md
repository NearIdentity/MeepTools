# MeepTools

This is a custom-built extension to the C++ version of MIT's Meep (MEEP) to facilitate simulation code development for my own PhD research. The first version is derived from a previously non-version-controlled edition of the code. The project includes the following function libraries:

\ Meep Control Support: Tools for defining and parsing named runtime variables for code development using Meep-C++

\ Meep Geometry Support: Tools for creating geometric objects (only simple shapes thus far, and only in 2D) for use with Meep-C++

\ Meep Detector Tools: Tools for performing angle-resolved transmission and reflection calculations (for 2D geometries thus far) in Meep. The code is intended to be fully compatible with Meep's MPI-based multi-processing capabilities. 

Use of these tools is unrestricted to anyone. However, no liability is assumed or implied for the outcome of such usage. 

Collaboration and suggestions are always welcome. =)

For details on how to use Meep-C++, please refer to the Meep documentation:
